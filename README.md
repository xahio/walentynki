Walentynki is a simple web application that allows the user to choose whether they want to be someone's valentine. If the user chooses "Tak" (Yes), they will see a hidden message with a secret surprise. If the user chooses "Nie" (No), they will see an alert saying "AHA obrażam się!" (I'm hurt!).

To use Walentynki, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The user will see a message asking if they want to be someone's valentine. They can choose "Tak" (Yes) or "Nie" (No) by clicking the corresponding button.

The application is styled using CSS in the styles.css file. The JavaScript code for handling the user's choice is in the script.js file.
